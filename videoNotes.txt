Main speaker - Robin Thompson - introduction by Eleanor Lee?
Sponsoring from XTX Markets.

ALOT OF THESE NOTES ARE DIRECT COPIES FROM VIDEO - SO MUST REFERENCE

* We live in extraordinary times - COVID 19 - pandemics
* This crisis has but mathematicians at the forefront.
	- World leaders talk about curves, exponentials, modeling, etc. Terms that come into public view.
	- Helping to understand/find ways out of crisis
	- What is an epidemic model?
	- Modeling is important for predictions - what data do we need?
	- How do we use models? In this context?

Robin Thompson speaking now:

* Junior research fellow in mathematics at Christ Church WCMB, Mathematical Institute
* Specializes in Infectious Disease Outbreak Modeling
* Math models are being used in real time to inform policy at a national level.

* Model - math representation of a system to explore behaviour of a system
* We look at data from an outbreak so far 
	- Construct a math model that represents the underlying behaviour
	- Run simulations to predict what might happen in the future
	- When we have a model that works well, we can introduce control interventions and work from there

IN NOTES I WILL TOUCH ON THESE QUESTIONS HE GOES OVER

1. How do we build a math model of an outbreak?
	a) Characteristic shape of an infectious disease outbreak???
	b) Building a basic model
	c) Representing epidemiological concepts?? R0, herd immunity?
	d) 5 extensions on basic model
2. How can models be used to inform public health measures at different stages of an outbreak?
	2.1) Early in outbreak?
	2.2) When outbreak is ongoing? COVID
	2.3) At the end of an outbreak?


1a) 
* Outbreaks do have characteristic shapes generally - in case of single wave outbreaks
* Virus increases until large number, slows down, peaks, and cases drop back down to near zero


1b) 
* The absolute simplest model would just be assuming something like sick people pass 3 infections per day
	- This would result in the case that the # of infected at any day of outbreak 'n' would be (3^n)
	- This just takes off - no peak. Does not represent reality.
	- Does ok for initial take-off, but stops from there.
	- We need to refine the model.
* Infections run out of healthy people to infect.

* So what do we do?
* Compartmental modeling 
	- Don't just keep track of how many individuals are infected. 
	- Keep track of individuals of all statuses.
	- Divide individuals into two groups. S (susceptible) to I (infected)

* Basic SI model is very similar to our disease Simulation 1.
* We can model the rate of change of S or I. 
	dS/dt = -(beta)SI
	dI/dt = betaSI
* The rate of change of S or I is dependent on the # of S and # of I at any point.
* beta governs the rate.
* This model fails to capture the decline in the model.

* So what do we do? Refine the model even more.

* Now we can include R (recovered and immune)
* SIR Model
	dS/dt = -(beta)SI
	dI/dt = betaSI - muI
	dR/dt = muI
* The rate of change of # of infected individuals now also depends on the rate of recovery
* muI is the rate of recovery (depends on I)

* Now the models actually pretty good for matching the data!
* Incredible job considering how simple it is. 

Basic SIR model captures the overall shape of the outbreak, and is simple to make. 
Simplifies thing a lot but is actually pretty useful for exploring keye epidemiological concepts.


1c)

* The basic reproduction number, R0
* R0 is the number of cases of disease arising from each primary case (in an entirely susceptible population)
	R0 = Infection rate * Duration of infection
	R0 = betaN * 1/mu
	R0 is like everything. 

N is # of individuals available to be infected.

* Herd immunity
	- The resistance to the spread of a disease that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune
	R0 = betaN * 1/mu

	- If N is reduced so is R0.
	- Immunity in system significantly affects rate of change.


1d) 
* Unfortunately reality is very complex. Infectious disease outbreaks do not always follow pretty curve.
* Many are inherently random in nature.
* COVID in South Korea and Italy behaved differently (similar) but there is a lot of chaos
* Jagged curves (not smooth like SIR)

* This brings us to stochastic models, which include a degree of randomness.
* For example each turn we could introduce the random chance someone gets sick, or randomly recovers.
* This can be further weighted (not a fair coin) - weighted to the number of S or I individuals at a given time

* We have to consider how epidemiology works and incorporate that into models.
* Social distancing rules in model?
* We can add more classes to the SIR model!
* SEIR (E is infected but not generating new infections)

* Other important things to consider - Age structure?
* How do different age groups come into contact with eachother/how often? Schools/nursing homes
* Cool age structure graphs - from UK in different settings

* Asymptomatic transmission? 
* May be misclassified as S when they are actually I and spreading.
* Isolate patients with clear symptoms when possible. 
* COVID wasn't really possible, a lot of infections driven by people w/o symptoms
* SAIR model (A for asymptomatic)

* Spatial structure incorporated for more reality? 
* Multiple connected SIR models, with coupling/rate of movement of people between regions
* Can change the rate of movement between two regions to signify more/less movement between



2.1) 
EARLY ON
* Try to isolate and reduce transmission
* "Fast isolation of imported infectious cases can reduce epidemic risk outside China"
* Higher R0 = Higher epidemic risk. 

2.2)
MIDDLE OF AN EPIDEMIC
2.2.1 - Observe data
2.2.2 - Develop model
2.2.3 - Estimate model parameters
2.2.4 - Make forecast/assess possible interventions

* Try to figure out possible new control variables/interventions to introduce.
* What has the best effect? Masking? Social Distancing?? Simulate it.

* "Flatten the curve" 
* Social distancing involves reducing the infection rate - reduces the overall infection rate
* This lowers the R0. This affects the whole model.
* Go from blue curve to orange/red curve.
* We don't want to overwhelm the system/hospitals/capacity for treatment.
* Allows time for hospitals to distribute PPE, gather supplies, reduce morbidity greatly.
* Vaccinations also reduces R0. (Lowers N - susceptible individuals)
* Getting that R0 below 1 is key.

* Periodic lockdowns are also helpful - reduces R0 periodically to keep # infected below treatable level

2.3)
END OF AN EPIDEMIC
* We havent seen cases in a while! 
* Possibly asymptomatic individuals around still spreading?
* We can determine confidence intervals for whether or not a disease outbreak really is over.
* WHO guidelines for 42 days only provide a 82% confidence interval that epidemic is over 


CONCLUSIONS FROM SPEAKER

* Infectious disease outbreaks have a characteristic shape that can be generated with simple infectious disease outbreak models
* Additional realism can be included
* Models can be used to make forecasts/predict the effects of interventions.

DATA -> MODEL -> REFINE -> FORECAST -> INTERVENTIONS
